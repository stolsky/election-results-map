# Open-Data-Election-Results
A simple Application, which analyzes election results by the populatin of its region.

# Development
1. define personas to create user stories in the form of `As <persona>, I want <goal>, so that <reason>.`
   * personas: App Provider, App User
   * Example: As an <App Provider>, I want to 
     * collect specific election results of Rostock and its districts to compare these result
     * collect additional election results of election district II, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Germany so I can compare these results
     * check if these election results satisfy certain data quality criteria, so I am sure to work with the most correct data
     * accumulate, process, â€¦ the data, so I can make the comparison 
2. define acceptance criteria for user stories
3. plan development according to user stories: what do we want to achieve and how
4. create iterations and its tasks
5. for each task create a new branch

# General workflow of the Application / Pipeline

## 1) Collection
1. import data from local disk or from web via REST API
   * json and csv files
2. parse data (into javascript objects to work with)

## 2) Analysis (according to Information Quality Criteria)
* search for missing, wrong attributes, values -> names, data types
  
## 3) Adjustments (according to Evaluation and Visualization)
* create identifier if necessary
* replace and unify attribute names
  * use generic names
* add missing attributes, values
* correct wrong data types, precision, etc...
* add dummy value if attribute is necessary else check with hasOwnProperty method
 
## 4) Evaluation
* filter and reduce data to necessary parts
  * only need second vote for CDU/CSU, SPD, FDP, Gruene, Linke, AfD
* compare, aggregate the data (prepare for visualization)
* selection, range, data types, names, etc..
 
## 5) Visualization
* visualize the data using certain libraries as d3.js
* integrate data into GUI
